# Coordinate-Matcher-Commission

Commission to my dad for his job. This program is used to find matching coordinates and identify them. It requires two input files that are in a specific format as seen in the input files.

The boost library is included, so you don't need to download it.

To run this all you need to do is compile it, then have this file structure
- coordinate_matcher.exe
- Input(Folder)
- Output(Folder)
